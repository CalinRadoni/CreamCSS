# CreamCSS

CSS framework uses `HTML Semantic Elements` and is built to be:

- `Lightweight`
- `Classless` (_almost_)
- `Responsive` and `Mobile First`

The framework selects the `light` or `dark` mode based on user's operating system settings.

## TODO

- decide if different hues are needed for light and dark modes
- make a test javascript to change the hue automatically, like a rainbow
