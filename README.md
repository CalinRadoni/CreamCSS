# CreamCSS

CSS framework uses `HTML Semantic Elements` and is built to be:

- `Lightweight`
- `Classless`[^*]
- `Responsive` and `Mobile First`

The framework selects the `light` or `dark` mode based on user's operating system settings.

[^*]: For added flexibility and to keep the code small I have added a few classes but their usage is optional.
